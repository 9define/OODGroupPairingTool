<h1>OOD (HW8) Group Pairing Tool</h1>
A script to read CSV files, create group pairings, and automate the process of sending emails.
<br/><br/>
Groups are ordered from best to worst, and assignments are given out such that the best group gets the worst group's code, the second best group get's the second worst group's code and so on.
<br/><br/>
Once all pairings are generated, the script will ask for email credentials for the sender account, and notify all groups of who they need to send their code to (their "downstream customers") and from whom they'll be receiving their code (their "upstream providers").
